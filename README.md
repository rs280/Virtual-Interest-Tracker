# Virtual-Interest-Tracker

Problem:
Distance learning, a new form of education for most people around the globe, is a foreign concept that bears skepticism for whether it is as beneficial to students compared to in-person classes. Students tend to lack motivation and engagement in learning in the comfort of their own homes. Since teachers are adapting to the new school system as well, students feel like they can take advantage of their teachers by cutting corners of their classes. 

Solution: 
Our project is a website that tracks whether the user is paying attention or not by Googleâ€™s Teachable Machine (Image Project) and JavaScript. The way it works is that an artificial intelligence scans through a series of images from separate classes and displays text on the screen with a certain sound effect based on the class/behavior of a person on the screen.
